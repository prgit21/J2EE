J2EE programs


1. Write a Program that simulates a telephone that records missed incoming calls.
 For each missed call, store the time of call, telephone number of origin, and name of the
caller if the name is available. For unlisted numbers, set the name to “private caller”.
Choose or extend the most appropriate collection class and provide the following
features.
Numbers are recalled in the order they arrive
Up to 10 numbers are recorded. When the eleventh call comes in, it is stored and the
oldest call is deleted so that no more than 10 numbers are ever recorded.
After each number display, the user can select
i. To delete the call
ii. To go on to the next missed call, or
iii. To display the call details (number, caller name and time).
Delete the number if user specifies a number to delete.
Write a helper class to represent an incoming call with fields to hold the number, name
of the caller, and time of the call. Write a tester call that stores the several numbers,
simulate the user pressing the missed-calls button, and finally prints the entire
collection of stored calls





2. Write a Java program using user-defined storage classes to create a book database and
store it in a Collection List. Books collection should include title, author, publisher and
price. Also write a method to sort the books in ascending order of price and store it in
another List. Maintain the book details with respect to an unique book id. Prompt for
an author name and list all the books with the same author name. Create a new list
holding all the book details with price greater than a user specified price. For a given a
value by the user, find all the books that match either the whole or a part of the book
title. Identify a publisher and print books from a particular publisher. Update the
publisher details based on a title.


3. Create a desktop java application using swings to enable an user to enter student
information such as name, usn, age, address, sgpa of 8 semesters, category. Perform
validations on age and sgpa. Display appropriate messages in pop up boxes to indicate
wrong entries, on clicking of the “compute” button. Also find the cgpa based on the
obtained sgpa. On clicking of the “done” button, place the student details in a
collection. A click on the “display” button should display the collection in a textarea.


4. Write a java program using swings to validate user login information using dialog
boxes. Once validated, allow the user to enter the customer id, if the person is a new
customer, else check whether the customer exists in a collection and obtain the
customer id. The customer id can be obtained given a mobile number. Allow the user
to enter the item purchased by giving the item id and quantity purchased. On clicking
of a button, the item name and the total cost should appear in the corresponding GUI
components. Using option dialog box, indicate the types of discount available for the
customer. On clicking on the print button, print the details in information dialog box.
